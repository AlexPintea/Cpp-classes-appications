For every:
- is it: example, trivial, application version, final application
- what it does - list
- just for linux / cross-platform


Braille EAN13: trivial, cross-platform

Consists of 2 seperate applications that were sent to the same contest.

Braille:
- offers features for both english and japanese braille systems
- replaces alphabet symbols ( individual letters for english and groups of letters for japanese ) with the binary representation of the braille alphabet
- able to translate files

EAN13 ( scannable codes you find on grocery ... ):
- converts the binary value of the code into readable integers
- conversion done using base 2 to base 10 conversion
- able to decode price and country




Brightly: final application, linux

- modifies the screen brightness
- offers the following options:
  1. Modify Bright - able to adjust the brightness up and down
                   - use [ and ] to dim up and down, type "done" to mention that you are done
  2. Bright Choices - presets for screen brightness ( 1. Bright  2. Default  3. Really bright  4. Normal )
  3. Continous slow - preset for unstoppable slow flicker ( only stoppable if you exit the application )
  4. Continous flicker - preset for unstoppable fast flicker ( only stoppable if you exit the application )
  more. More Birghties - executes a user-defined series of flickers, which stops when completed ( does not repeat like the 'continous' presets )
                       - users are asked to 
  reset. Reset Bright - resets brightness to default

 [exit]. Exits - exist the application

Improvements:
- get the screen name, do not ask the user to enter it
- make it so that the user is able to make their custom preset repeat
- make more presets for the user that they can choose / edit / delete / add
- remake the interface so that it has: 1. Modify brightness ( merge 1 and 2 ),  2. Show ( merge 3, 4 and more ), reset, info ( about each option ) and exit.
