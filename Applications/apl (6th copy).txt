- offers the following options:
  1. Modify Bright - able to adjust the brightness up and down
                   - use [ and ] to dim up and down, type "done" to mention that you are done
  2. Bright Choices - presets for screen brightness ( 1. Bright  2. Default  3. Really bright  4. Normal )
  3. Continous slow - preset for unstoppable slow flicker ( only stoppable if you exit the application )
  4. Continous flicker - preset for unstoppable fast flicker ( only stoppable if you exit the application )
  more. More Birghties - executes a user-defined series of flickers, which stops when completed ( does not repeat like the 'continous' presets )
                       - users are asked to 
  reset. Reset Bright - resets brightness to default

common frev multiple: final application, cross-platform
- used to determine the most common words by topic
- when a file is added ( to a topic or not ), the freqvency for each of its words is calculated and added next to the word in a file. After adding the words of the file with their freqvencies to a file that stores the most common words without regard to any topic, the user is asked if they want to add the file to a topic too. The process is repeated for the specified topic file.
- available options:
	- 1. Add File - adds the words of a file and their freqvencies to the "most common words" file. If needed, they are also added to a "most common words" file of a topic.

- stores applications names and their description 
- has a search feature that gives exact results and also makes suggestions for applications that are simmilar with the applications found. In order to determine that 2 applications are simmilar, their descriptions and names are compared. Usual words are excluded when it comes to searching, since the user might want to store only applications that belong to a certain topic, for example "history" the word "history" needs not be searched and is therefore excluded at seatch. So, the user can exclude certain words.

Improvements
- make the usual words not be taken into consideration at search
- make it able to install an application ( copy the executable )
- make subcategory for adding usual words ( do not show it as a primary function, make another interface for that )

Improvements:
- the common words and the lines they appear on are not counted correctly, only need to increment in 1 for, not in both  ( lines 290 )
- delete the "lines" files

remove: 
- given files on a certain topic, the application determines common words and makes a file consisting of the most used uncommon words in order.
- if the application realises that the file that was added belongs to a topic that was added before by another file, the "most used uncommon words" of the files are merged
- available options:
  add. Add usual word          adds. Add usual words - add 1 or multiple usual words
  remove.  Remove usual word   removes. Remove usual words - remove 1 or multiple usual words
  [help].  Enter text, enter which words make sense to improve - you improve the application by adding text and mentioning afterwards which if the words are uncommon ( to determine which are common )
  [enter]. Enter text and get words that make sense - type text and get the uncommon words 
  [sense]. Enter a word and get correlated words - using the "most used uncommon words" files, the application gives you words related to a word you enter
  files.   Show save file filenames - show filenames for the files with most used uncommon words
  show. Show usual words - shows common words
  copy. Make a copy of "usual_words" file - copies the usual words file, in case you need it
  save. Save usual words ( done anyways ) - save feature, just to make the user feel safe
  exit. Exit - exits the application
- the application does not crash when the user enters wrong data ( data is takes as a string, then converted if needed )
- other available options for editing save files:
  add. Add save word          adds. Add save words - add 1 or multiple unusual words for a "most used uncommon words" file
  remove.  Remove save word   removes. Remove save words - remove 1 or multiple unusual words out of a "most used uncommon words" file
  show. Show words of a save file - shows uncommon words of a "most used uncommon words" file
  files. Consider / Do not consider a save file for correlations - help by excluding files that seem to not have words that correlate with each other
  copy. Make a copy of a save file - copy a save file for the user
